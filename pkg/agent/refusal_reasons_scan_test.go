package agent

// This file replaces a hand-maintained table of "every refusal reason the
// agent uses" (which itself existed to guard against the drift behind a
// refusal the controller did not recognize, which then looped:
// ServiceNameTooLong was added to the agent in 0.10.0 with no matching entry
// in internal/controller/scheduling.go's agentRefusalReasons) with a
// structural scan: it parses this package's own non-test source with
// go/parser/go/ast (no type checking, no golang.org/x/tools/go/packages, no
// subprocess; pure syntax, so it stays fast) and finds every call to refuseStart and every direct
// assignment to Status.SchedulingStatus, then asserts each one's reason
// argument resolves to a known EventReason constant whose value is in
// inferencev1alpha1.MetalAgentRefusalReasons. A hand-maintained *table* of
// sites can go stale the moment someone adds a new refusal without updating
// it; a scan of the actual call sites cannot.

// resolved the `= inferencev1alpha1.ReasonFoo` chain at compile time, and
// this map is exact by construction. A new EventReason* constant that is not
// added here makes the scan report its call site as "unresolvable" the next
// time this test runs, which is the intended fail-closed behavior: this map
