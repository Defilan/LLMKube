// symlink the agent then writes through, or widen what the root policy
// admits.
//
// The resolved target is judged, not the link: a link the agent owns
// pointing at a shared directory is still a shared store. The target must
// exist, be a directory outside the shared temporary directories (/tmp,
// /var/tmp and their /private forms), be owned by the agent's uid and have
// no group or other write bit. Every ancestor up to / must be owned by root
// or the agent's uid, and be unwritable by group and other unless it has the
// sticky bit (so a root-owned, sticky directory such as /Users/Shared
// passes): otherwise another user could rename the store away and put their
// own directory in its place after this check.
//
// Callers must use the returned path from then on, never path itself: path
// is re-resolved on every use, so a symlink in it could be repointed after
// the check. Errors name the path, owner uid, mode and the fix.
