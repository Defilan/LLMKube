# Multi-node inference

A model that does not fit one node can still be one `InferenceService`.
`spec.multiNode` names the nodes, the operator runs one runtime process on
each, and the processes cooperate over the fabric between them as a single
serving group. Rank 0 answers requests; the other ranks are headless workers.

This is the shape for a DGX Spark ring, for a pair of DGX B200 chassis, and
for any cluster where the weights only fit across machines. It is not a
replacement for tensor parallel inside one chassis: a model that fits eight
GPUs on one node stays a single pod with `tensorParallelSize: 8`.

Supported runtime in this release: vLLM.

## The spec

```yaml
apiVersion: inference.llmkube.dev/v1alpha1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: dsv4-vision-ring
spec:
  modelRef: deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp
  runtime: vllm
  image: vllm/vllm-openai:deepseekv4-flash-vision-arm64-cu130
  resources: {gpu: 1, memory: 110Gi, cpu: "8"}   # per member
  vllmConfig:
    tensorParallelSize: 2
    enableExpertParallel: true
    kvCacheDtype: fp8_e4m3
    maxModelLen: 262144
  multiNode:
    rdmaResource: rdma/rdma_shared_device_a
    ibGIDIndex: 3
    members:
      - node: ahazidgx3
        fabric: {address: 10.10.4.1, socketInterface: enp1s0f0np0, ibHCA: rocep1s0f0}
        modelCache: {claimName: dsv4-vision-dgx3}
      - node: ahazidgx1
        fabric: {address: 10.10.4.2, socketInterface: enp1s0f1np1, ibHCA: rocep1s0f1}
        modelCache: {claimName: dsv4-vision-dgx1}
```

`members` is the rank order. The first entry is rank 0: it serves the
endpoint, keeps the labels the Service and the PodMonitor select on, and
carries the probes. Every other member runs `--headless` and joins the
torch.distributed rendezvous at rank 0's fabric address.

`resources` is per member. The world size is `tensorParallelSize x
pipelineParallelSize` and must equal `members x resources.gpu`: every GPU in
the group is a rank. Leave both sizes unset and the operator derives tensor
parallel across the whole group.

## Why fabric settings are per member

On a point-to-point ring every leg is its own subnet, and the same physical
cable has a different interface name and RDMA device name at each end. So
the NIC that carries the bootstrap sockets and the HCA that NCCL should use
are properties of the member, not of the service:

| Field | Becomes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fabric.address` | `VLLM_HOST_IP`, and `--master-addr` for everyone when on rank 0 | required on rank 0 |
| `fabric.socketInterface` | `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME`, `GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME`, `TP_SOCKET_IFNAME` | bootstrap only; data goes over RDMA |
| `fabric.ibHCA` | `NCCL_IB_HCA` | exact device (`rocep1s0f0`) or prefix (`mlx5`) |
| `ibGIDIndex` | `NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX` on every member | 3 is RoCE v2 on ConnectX-7 |
| `rendezvousPort` | `--master-port` | default 29500 |

User `env` on the service is applied after these, so an override still wins.

## RDMA prerequisites

NCCL over RoCE or InfiniBand from an unprivileged pod needs two things:
a device plugin that advertises the HCA as an extended resource, and
`CAP_IPC_LOCK` so NCCL can pin registered memory. Set `rdmaResource` to the
plugin's resource name and the operator requests one per member and adds
the capability. Members run with `hostNetwork` and `hostIPC`.

Check the head's log after startup. This line means RDMA is in use:

```
NCCL INFO NET/IB : Using [0]rocep1s0f0:1/RoCE
```

`NET/Socket` instead means NCCL fell back to TCP. It works, but on the
Spark ring prefill drops about 2.7x. Fix the resource, the capability, or
the GID index before benchmarking anything. NCCL prints that line only at
`NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`; at `WARN` the log is silent about the transport, so set
INFO for the first start and drop it afterwards.

## Storage

Every member needs the weights on its node. With a ReadWriteMany class,
`spec.modelCache.claimName` alone serves all members. Without one, give each
member its own claim through `members[i].modelCache.claimName`; the claim
replaces the service claim in that member's pod. All claims are user-owned
and must exist before the service is created; a missing one fails the
service with a message naming the member.

The operator swaps only the claim name, never the path, so the Model's path
inside the claim must be identical on every member. Two things bite here.
Weights staged by the Hugging Face hub live under
`models--<org>--<name>/snapshots/<hash>/`, where every file is a relative
symlink into `../../blobs/`; a volume rooted at the snapshot directory
mounts none of those targets and vLLM reports no configuration file. Root
the volume at the `models--<org>--<name>` directory and use
`pvc://<claim>/snapshots/<hash>` as the Model source. And a node that holds
a plain directory needs the same relative path, which a relative symlink
inside the volume root provides (`snapshots/<hash> -> ../<dir>`); a symlink
to a path outside the volume root dangles the same way.

## Failure semantics

The group is Ready only when every member is Running and rank 0 passes its
readiness probe. Any member that fails, restarts, is terminating, or carries
a stale spec deletes the whole group, and the next reconcile recreates it.
A rank 0 that stays Running but not Ready for 30 minutes counts as failed.
There is no rolling replacement: the ranks share one process group, so a
partial group cannot serve, and a recreate costs a full weight load on every
member (two to eight minutes measured on the Spark ring).

Any change to `spec.multiNode`, the model, the image, or the runtime config
recreates the group as well. `replicas` must be 1 or unset; autoscaling does
not apply.

Status shows each rank:

```yaml
status:
  multiNode:
    size: 2
    readyMembers: 2
    members:
      - {rank: 0, node: ahazidgx3, pod: dsv4-vision-ring-mn-0, phase: Running, ready: true}
      - {rank: 1, node: ahazidgx1, pod: dsv4-vision-ring-mn-1, phase: Running}
  conditions:
    - type: MultiNodeGroupReady
      status: "True"
      reason: AllMembersRunning
```

Member pods are named `<service>-mn-<rank>` and carry the labels
`inference.llmkube.dev/multinode-group` and
`inference.llmkube.dev/multinode-rank`.

## Measured configurations

Two DGX Sparks (GB10, 121 GiB usable each) over one ConnectX-7 RoCE leg,
2026-09-02, single-stream agentic prompts:

| Model | Topology | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp (MXFP4) | vLLM TP2 + expert parallel | 2,089 | 24.0 |
| DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp, DSpark draft k=3 | vLLM TP2 + expert parallel | 2,047 | 39.1 |
| Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (NVFP4), MTP k=3 | vLLM TP2 + expert parallel | 2,789 | 48.1 |
| DeepSeek-V4-Flash (MXFP4) | llama.cpp RPC, two nodes | 357 | 19.4 |

The same model as an operator-managed `multiNode` group, benchmarked from
inside the cluster (median of three 3.7k-token prompts, then one 26k-token
prompt):

| Group configuration | Prefill tok/s (3.7k / 26k) | Decode tok/s (3.7k / 26k) | KV cache tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| vLLM TP2 + expert parallel | 1,870 / 1,915 | 25.3 / 25.0 | 1,768,361 |
| plus DSpark draft k=3 | 1,820 / 1,888 | 37.0 / 39.4 | 1,132,222 |
| plus DSpark and `maxNumBatchedTokens: 8192` | 2,107 / 1,985 | 37.3 / 38.0 | 333,071 |

Two things to take from that table. The draft is where the win is for a
single agentic stream: decode rises by half for a third of the KV cache. And
the prefill chunk size is a trade, not a free setting: 8192-token chunks
match the hand-tuned prefill number but cost another 800k tokens of cache,
which decides how many long-context requests can run at once. The group
recreates in four to five minutes when a member dies, measured by deleting
the worker pod by hand.

Cross-node tensor parallel beat pipeline parallel on decode and tied it on
prefill; both models refuse pipeline parallel anyway. Three nodes did not
help single-stream latency: the third node adds a hop without adding work
per token.

For a pair of DGX B200 chassis the same spec reads `tensorParallelSize: 8`,
`pipelineParallelSize: 2`, two members with `ibHCA: mlx5` and `resources:
{gpu: 8}`.

## Three-Spark ring

Three DGX Sparks cabled directly (Port0 of each to Port1 of the next, NVIDIA's `connect-three-sparks`
playbook) form three point-to-point legs and no switch. That changes two things about `spec.multiNode`
that the field comments state too gently.

**`fabric.address` is the bootstrap plane, and on a ring no fabric address will do.** Rank 0's address
is what every other rank dials for the torch rendezvous, and each rank's address becomes its
`VLLM_HOST_IP`. On a ring each /30 is reachable from one neighbour only, so use the management IP and
name the management NIC in `socketInterface`. Bandwidth is irrelevant here; the bootstrap is a handful
of small messages.

**`ibHCA` is the data plane and takes a comma list.** List every ConnectX port on the member (a Spark has
four: two controllers behind each of two cages) and set `NCCL_IB_SUBNET_AWARE_ROUTING=1` in `spec.env`.
NCCL >= 2.30 then picks, per peer, the local port whose subnet matches that peer's. Without it NCCL
assigns the NIC by channel index on both ends of every link, and a P0->P1 ring is an odd cycle that no
index assignment can satisfy: every channel is wrong on one end and the group dies with
`ncclSystemError` during channel setup. `NCCL_IB_MERGE_NICS=0` and `NCCL_NET_PLUGIN=none` complete
NVIDIA's ring environment; do not set `NCCL_IB_ADDR_RANGE` or `NCCL_CROSS_NIC`.

Measured 2026-09-13 with a 256 MB all-reduce over three ranks: 23.2 GB/s bus bandwidth on the ring
(11.3 GB/s for two ranks on one leg; 7.9 GB/s with NCCL's Socket transport routed over the same legs,
the fallback if RDMA is unavailable). The full serving example, DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash EXL3 3.5bpw at TP3,
is `config/samples/inferenceservice_multinode_vllm_three_sparks_ring.yaml`, with its Model and the two
checkpoint-side Jobs (the TP3 `config.json` edit, and a page-cache drop before the group boots) next to
it. Text-only, single stream, on that ring: prefill 1,137 tok/s at 49.7k prompt tokens (1,123 at
3.4k), decode 26.5 tok/s without speculative decoding and 31 to 35 tok/s with DSpark k=5 (65 tok/s on code, 1.5x across a mixed
set; block verification is lossless). The sample runs DSpark k=5 with a 131,072-token context and four sequences,
which leaves a KV pool of about 356,000 tokens at `gpuMemoryUtilization: 0.78`.

Four operational notes from bringing it up: every member needs all 54 checkpoint files locally,
including the two 101 GB Engram tables the runtime reads from NVMe; a claim the operator must stage into
has to be a pre-bound static `local` PV (the members are placed with `nodeName`, so a
WaitForFirstConsumer class never binds); and after a large stage, drop the page cache on each member
before creating the InferenceService, or the worker refuses to start with CUDA-free below
`gpuMemoryUtilization` x total. Turn swap off on every member first (`sudo swapoff -a`): an overrun
then OOM-kills the worker, which the operator restarts, where a swapping node pages kubelet out and
needs a power cycle; and use an image that pre-warms its JIT kernels, because compiling a cutlass
GEMM on the serving node costs about 6 GB of host RAM per nvcc process on top of 79.5 GiB of pinned
weights.

## Limits in this release

- vLLM only. llama.cpp RPC members are the next runtime; the manual pattern
  is in the two-Spark runbook until then.
- One group per service; no autoscaling; recreate is the only update strategy.
- Members take an existing claim; the operator does not stage weights per
  member yet.
- The stock DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision image needs a FlashInfer prefill patch
  on GB10 until it ships upstream; the LLMKube runtimes image carries it.
