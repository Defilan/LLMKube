# Model storage

LLMKube serves each model's GGUF from a PersistentVolumeClaim mounted into the inference pod. How that cache is provisioned is controlled by `modelCache.mode`.

## Modes

### `shared` (default)

A single cluster-wide cache PVC (`llmkube-model-cache`) that the operator mounts and every inference pod shares, created by the operator in the InferenceService's namespace:

- The pod's **init container downloads each remote model into the shared PVC**, so all InferenceServices reuse one cache (**cross-service dedup**: a model is downloaded once and reused by every service that references it).
- `llmkube cache list` inspects this PVC, so cache inspection works out of the box.
- This is the proven default and is a drop-in for existing single-node clusters.

On a **multi-node** cluster, pair `shared` with **ReadWriteMany** storage (NFS, CephFS, EFS, etc.) so the cache is reachable from any node:

```yaml
modelCache:
  mode: shared
  accessMode: ReadWriteMany
  storageClass: <your-rwx-class>
```

With the default RWO storage class the shared PVC is pinned to one node, so it only works single-node (a GPU on any other node would hit a `volume node affinity conflict`). If your multi-node cluster has no RWX storage class, use `perService` instead.

### `perService` (opt-in escape hatch)

For multi-node clusters **without** an RWX storage class. Each InferenceService gets its own cache PVC (`<inferenceservice>-model-cache`):

- **RWO**, no explicit StorageClass, so it binds `WaitForFirstConsumer` — on whatever node the inference pod is scheduled to.
- The pod's **init container downloads the model into that PVC**, so the download and the server land on the same node by construction.
- Owner-referenced to the InferenceService, so it is garbage-collected when the service is deleted.
- This mode requires the external provisioner to schedule its helper path on the selected node. On a strictly tainted node where the helper cannot tolerate the taint, use `spec.modelCache.claimName` with a pre-provisioned claim instead (see below).

This makes **heterogeneous, multi-node clusters work without RWX**: an InferenceService whose accelerator is on node B (e.g. an AMD/Vulkan node distinct from the operator's node) schedules on node B and caches its model there (see #728).

```yaml
modelCache:
  mode: perService
```

Trade-offs: models are **not deduplicated across InferenceServices** (each service downloads and stores its own copy). Prefer `shared` + an RWX storage class on multi-node clusters that have one.

### Pre-provisioned claim (`spec.modelCache.claimName`)

Strict-taint users can use `spec.modelCache.claimName` with a pre-provisioned, node-aligned PVC. This path does not depend on dynamic helper scheduling: the claim already exists and is bound, so no external provisioner helper pod needs to land on the tainted node. The inference pod's init containers handle the download into the existing claim.

### Cache inspection

`llmkube cache list` discovers the shared cache and operator-managed per-service cache PVCs. A user-managed `spec.modelCache.claimName` PVC is outside the operator's cache label/discovery contract and may not appear in the listing.

## Choosing a mode

| Cluster | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Single-node | `shared` (default) |
| Multi-node with an RWX storage class | `shared` + `accessMode: ReadWriteMany` + `storageClass: <rwx-class>` |
| Multi-node without RWX | `perService` |

## OCI image sources (`oci://`)

A model can be delivered as an OCI **container image** and mounted directly by
the Kubernetes **ImageVolume**:

```yaml
source: oci://registry.defilan.net/models/qwen3-32b@sha256:<digest>
```

The image is mounted read-only at `/model-source`, the same contract the
`pvc://` path uses. Because the kubelet and the node runtime pull and mount
it, an `oci://` model has **no downloader init container and no cache PVC**:
`spec.modelCache` is ignored for this source type, and the cache bug class
around PVC provisioning does not apply. Pull credentials come from
`InferenceService.spec.imagePullSecrets`, the same as any container image,
so private registries and air-gapped mirrors work with no extra configuration.

Pin by **digest** (`@sha256:...`) so a served model is immutable and
reproducible. A tag works but re-resolves when the pod restarts.

### What the image must contain

The reference must be a **container image** whose filesystem holds the weights, as
a `tar` / `tar+gzip` / `tar+zstd` layer. A raw OCI artifact (ModelPack, Docker
Model Artifact, an `oras push` with a model media type) is not a substitute: under
containerd the kubelet unpacks only tar image layers and mounts the volume
**empty** for any other layer media type (containerd issues #11381 / #11907).
CRI-O is more permissive; do not rely on that for a portable manifest.

The image's filesystem is mounted at `/model-source` and the served file is
`/model-source/<primary>`, where `<primary>` is

- `spec.files[0]` (or `spec.mmproj`), read as a path **relative to the image
  root**, when the file list is explicit; or
- `<Model.metadata.name>.gguf` (or the resolved `Status.GGUF.ModelName`) when
  `spec.files` is empty.

So put the weights at the **image root**, under the name LLMKube serves. The
KServe / Red Hat modelcar convention (`COPY weights /models/`) does not match: it
mounts at `/model-source/models/...`.

A minimal, correct image:

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
COPY ./qwen3-32b.gguf /
```

### Cluster requirement

`oci://` needs **Kubernetes >= 1.36** on the serving node (ImageVolume reached
GA there) and a supporting container runtime: **containerd >= 2.1.0** or
**CRI-O >= 1.31**. The capability lives on the node, not the API server, so a
node whose runtime cannot serve the volume fails the pod.

The operator refuses an `oci://` Model on a control plane below 1.36 with an
`UnsupportedCluster` condition naming the floor, rather than rendering a pod
that cannot start. Below the floor, use `pvc://`, `s3://`, or `hf://`, which
all work on older clusters and are the paths for edge, K3s, ARM, and Jetson
deployments.

See `docs/proposals/1379-oci-imagevolume-model-source.md` for the evaluation
behind this source type.

## Metadata

In `perService` mode the operator reads GGUF metadata (architecture, layer count, context length, etc.) for `Model.Status` by reading **only the file header** over HTTP range requests — it never downloads the whole model itself. The full model bytes are fetched only by the init container, on the serving node. `pvc://` and HuggingFace-repo sources are resolved at pod runtime and are unaffected.

## Multi-artifact staging

`spec.source` may name a repository or bucket **prefix** rather than a single object. In that case `spec.files` selects which artifacts to stage from it, and `files[0]` is the primary file handed to the runtime. This is how a sharded GGUF, an `mmproj`, or draft weights are expressed. All listed files land in **one cache directory**, so a sharded GGUF resolves its siblings by path.

```yaml
source: s3://models/org/Repo-GGUF
files:
  - Model-00001-of-00002.gguf
  - Model-00002-of-00002.gguf
mmproj: mmproj-model-f16.gguf
```

When `spec.files` is empty, `spec.source` must name a single object directly.

An `oci://` source carries every file in the image already, so
`spec.files` selects the primary file within that tree and nothing is fetched
per file. Use **explicit paths**: a glob cannot be expanded against an OCI
image, which provides no file listing, and the Model fails loudly rather
than serving a wrong path.
