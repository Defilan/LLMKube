# Regression test for envtest control-plane sharing in internal/controller
# (#2141).
#
# A control plane is an etcd plus a kube-apiserver, about 4 s to start. Before
# this test existed, 63 tests in internal/controller each started a private
# one, so the package ran at go test's 10 minute timeout on CI runners and the
# Tests job failed at random. The fix is one envtest.Environment per CRD set,
# started lazily and stopped by TestMain, with each test working in a
# generated namespace (internal/controller/envtest_shared_test.go).
#
# The rule this enforces: internal/controller's tests construct an
# envtest.Environment only in envtest_shared_test.go (the helpers) and
# suite_test.go (the Ginkgo suite). A test that writes its own bypasses the
# sharing and the TestMain budget, so it fails here instead of on a runner
# eleven minutes into the job.
#
# Scoped to internal/controller on purpose. The other envtest packages finish
# well inside the limit and keep their own control planes: internal/watchcanary
# 7 s, pkg/cli 12 s, internal/foreman/controller 19 s, 64 to 171 times under
# the 20m limit. The rule would be churn there.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-envtest-sharing_test.sh
