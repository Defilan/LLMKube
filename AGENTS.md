# AGENTS.md

LLMKube is a Kubernetes operator that deploys and manages local LLM inference
workloads. Go 1.26, built with controller-runtime / Kubebuilder.

This file is the source of truth for the engineering conventions that agents and
contributors share. The human onboarding narrative lives in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Setup

- Go 1.26+ (pinned in `go.mod`).
- `make test` downloads envtest binaries on first run; no cluster needed for
  unit tests.
- `make test-chart` needs `helm` and the `helm-unittest` plugin.
- `make test-e2e` requires Docker and Kind.

## Definition of done

A change is not done until all of these hold.

1. The pre-commit gate passes: `make fmt`, `make vet`, `make lint`, `make test`.
2. The pre-push gate passes: `make lint-all`. If `charts/` changed, run
   `make test-chart`. If CRD types in `api/v1alpha1/` changed, run
   `make generate` and `make chart-crds`, then `git status` must be clean.
   Uncommitted generated files mean a step was skipped, and the CI CRD sync
   check will fail.
3. Every behavior change has a test that fails without it. Before adding an
   assertion, name the production edit that would make it fail. If you cannot,
   the assertion does not bite. Paste the failure you saw, not a paraphrase.
4. The tests assert on side effects, not return values. A controller test must
   check the world changed the way the spec requires (an object exists, a file
   is on disk, a condition carries the cause), not merely that the code
   returned what it returns. Issue #374 is the canonical case.
5. You can name every consumer of anything you touched (a resource, an
   endpoint, a port, a wire payload, a command-line contract) and what must stay
   true for it. A change that fixes one path while silently breaking a consumer
   is not done.
6. The PR description matches the code. No claim in it that a test or the diff
   does not back.

## Code style

- Match the surrounding code: naming, error handling, comment density, layout.
  Do not introduce a different style for new code.
- Idiomatic Go: `gofmt`, wrapped errors (`fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`), table-driven tests.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Do not add docstrings or decorative
  comments to hit a quota.
- Controller code follows controller-runtime conventions: reconcilers are
  idempotent, garbage collection uses owner references, state is surfaced
  through status conditions.

## Testing

- Every behavior change needs a test. A bug fix gets a regression test that
  fails before the fix and passes after.
- Unit tests use `envtest` (controller-runtime); they run with `make test` and
  need no live cluster. For the blessed envtest patterns and the common traps,
  see `docs/contributing/envtest-guide.md`.
- Assert observable behavior, not internal implementation detail.
- Do not weaken or delete a test to make a change pass. If a test is genuinely
  wrong, fix it and say why.
- Do not test a contract against a double built from the consumer's own type. A
  stub that constructs its payload with the same type the code decodes pins
  nothing: a rename of a wire field leaves it green. Feed the real producer's
  bytes, or assert both sides of the contract.

## Commits

This repo uses conventional commit prefixes so `release-please` can generate
changelogs and version bumps. Every commit needs one:

| Prefix      | Use for                                   | Version bump |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `feat:`     | New feature, CRD field, CLI command       | minor        |
| `fix:`      | Bug fix, correctness improvement          | patch        |
| `perf:`     | Performance improvement                   | patch        |
| `docs:`     | Documentation only                        | patch        |
| `chore:`    | Deps, CI, tooling (hidden from changelog) | none         |
| `test:`     | Test-only change (hidden)                 | none         |
| `refactor:` | Refactor, no behavior change (hidden)     | none         |

Use `feat!:` / `fix!:` for breaking changes.

- Sign off every commit: `git commit -s`. A human is accountable for every
  commit, however it was produced (DCO is enforced by CI; bot-only sign-offs
  are not accepted).
- Subject says *what* changed; body says *why*. No implementation play-by-play.
- Keep commit messages free of attribution trailers (`Co-Authored-By`,
  `AI-Agent`, `Assisted-by`, etc.). Disclose AI assistance in the PR
  description instead, per `CONTRIBUTING.md` ("AI-Assisted and Agent
  Contributions").
- One logical change per commit.

## Branches and pull requests

- Contributions go through fork-based PRs. Branch from an up-to-date `main`.
- Branch names: `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`, `refactor/<slug>`,
  `chore/<slug>`.
- PRs follow `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (What / Why / How / Checklist)
  and reference the issue with `Fixes #N`.
- Do not push to `main`. Do not force-push shared branches.

The core API group (`api/v1alpha1/`) holds the inference CRDs (Model,
InferenceService, ModelPool, ModelRouter, and the rest). Foreman and federation
are separate API groups under their own directories.

## Runtime-arg parity

Any new `InferenceServiceSpec` field that changes the llama-server command
line must be wired into **all three** of these places, with a test for each:

1. `LlamaCppBackend.BuildArgs`:
   `internal/controller/runtime_llamacpp.go` (and the helper in
   `runtime_llamacpp_args.go`). This is the controller-side arg builder that
   renders the args for the in-cluster container.
2. The metal-agent path:
   `MetalAgent.ensureProcess` -> `buildExecutorConfig` (in
   `pkg/agent/agent.go`) -> `MetalExecutor.StartProcess` /
   `buildLlamaServerArgs` (in `pkg/agent/executor.go`). The metal-agent is
   the out-of-cluster sibling that runs llama-server natively on Apple
   Silicon hosts; its flags must match the controller's.
3. `computeSpecHash` (in `pkg/agent/agent.go`): any field that changes the
   command line must also be folded into the spec hash so a change triggers
   a respawn instead of a no-op.

When adding a new field, mirror the existing `resolveCacheTypes` comment in
`pkg/agent/agent.go`: add a one-line note in the new arg-builder site
explaining that it mirrors the other side, and add a single table-driven
Go test that feeds one representative `InferenceService` spec (with the
runtime-affecting fields set) through **both** `LlamaCppBackend.BuildArgs`
and the metal-agent's `buildLlamaServerArgs`, asserting the same flags
appear on both sides for each field. This is the parity guard; it catches
drift the moment someone wires a field into one side and forgets the other.

Do **not** refactor the two arg builders into one shared function; they
serve different runtimes and have different defaults. The parity test is
the contract, not shared code.

## Security-sensitive invariants

- **Enforcement code is adversarial.** Anything between a client request and a
  decision (a charge, an allow, a route) is driven by input the client
  controls. For every guard, fallback, default, or early return, name the input
  that reaches it and whether a client controls it. A guard whose fallback a
  client can trigger needs a test at the request path, not only a unit case for
  the helper.
- **Contracts that cross a process boundary are duplicated.** The router
  proxy's budget wire tags and the operator's decoder are one pair; the three
  runtime-arg sites above are another. Test them with the real producer's
  bytes or type, never with a double built from the consumer side.
- **A ClusterIP is not a network boundary.** Any new Service port, endpoint, or
  admin surface is reachable by every pod in the cluster once it exists. State
  the default posture in the change, and scope it (NetworkPolicy, an internal
  Service, auth) or say why not.
- **A privileged syscall in a container needs runtime reasoning, not just a
  rendered-spec test.** Do not run an init/main container that performs a
  privileged syscall (`chown`, `chmod` of an unowned file, `mount`, etc.)
  non-root with `capabilities.add` when the syscall runs in an exec'd child
  (`command: ["sh", "-c", "chown ..."]`). A non-root process loses its
  capabilities across `execve` unless the runtime sets ambient capabilities,
  which is runtime-dependent (it works on kind but not on every cluster, so
  envtest and CI will pass while real users hit `EPERM`). Either run the
  container as root (uid 0, still `Drop: [ALL]` + the minimal caps + no
  privilege escalation), or do the syscall directly in the container's
  entrypoint (a small helper binary) so the caps are not cleared. This caused
  the 0.8.20 `model-cache-prep` regression (#887).

## Do not

- Do not hand-edit generated files (`zz_generated.*`, CRD YAML under `config/`
  and `charts/`). Change the source and regenerate.
- Do not edit `.claude/worktrees/` or `bin/`; they are local checkout and build
  artifacts, not source.
- Do not commit secrets, kubeconfigs, or `.env` files.
- Do not skip the pre-commit checks or the CRD sync step.
